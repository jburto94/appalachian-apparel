# Appalachian Apparel

A Clothing website with user authentication and a payment system.

## Why I built this
To create a eCommerece store without having to create the backend myself. I built the frontend using React and the backend is handled through Firebase. No payments can go through as the app is using a test stripe account, but the payment authentication still works.
